Hello, I'm a PhD student at [Purdue Digital Twin Lab](https://purduedigitaltwin.github.io/), supervised by Prof. [Ziran Wang](https://ziranw.github.io/). I received both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Civil Engineering from Seoul National University in Korea. <br><br>
My research focuses on 3D scene understanding and language-conditioned world models, with particular interest in Gaussian splatting, multi-view reasoning, and language-guided 3D scene reconstruction. I aim to advance autonomous driving through multi-modal embeddings and digital twin simulation, making perception and planning more interactive, explainable, and trustworthy.
