Hello, I'm a second-year PhD student at [Purdue Digital Twin Lab](https://purduedigitaltwin.github.io/), supervised by Prof. [Ziran Wang](https://ziranw.github.io/). I received both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Civil Engineering from Seoul National University in Korea. <br><br>
My research focuses on 3D/4D scene understanding and language-conditioned world models, with particular interest in Gaussian splatting and multi-modal LLMs. I'd like to advance autonomous driving through making perception and planning more interactive, explainable, and trustworthy.
